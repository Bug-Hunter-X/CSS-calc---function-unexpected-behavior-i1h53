The corrected CSS code with proper spacing and units:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

This version ensures the calculation is performed correctly, providing the intended result.  Always ensure spaces are included around operators (+, -, *, /) and all values have units (px, em, rem, %, etc.) within `calc()` to avoid unexpected behavior.
